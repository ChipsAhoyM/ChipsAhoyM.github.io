I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. with Prof. Boxin Shi at Camera Intelligence Lab, School of Computer Science, PKU. My current research interest lies in Computational Photography and mainly works on Neuromorphic Cameras (e.g. DVS, Prophesee, Vidar). I am also interested in photography and world history.
